Project Q4
"Write a program that takes its input from a file of numbers of type double. The program outputs to the screen the average and standard dviation of the numbers in the file. The file contains nothing but numbers of type double separated by blanks and/or line breaks. The standard deviation of a list of numbers n1, n2, n3, and so forth is defined as the square root of the average of the following numbers:

(n1-a)^2, (n2-a)^2, (n3-a)^2 and so forth

The number a is the averae of the numbers n1, n2, n3, and so forth."

Project Q7
"Write a program that merges the numbers in two files and writes all the numbers into a third file. Your program takes input from two different files and writes its output to a third file. Each input file contains a list of numbers of type int in sorted order from the smallest to the largest. After the program is run, the output file will contain all the numbers in the two input files in one longer list in sorted order from smallest to largest. Your program should define a function that is called with the two input file streams and output file stream as three arguments."

Project Q9
"Write a program to compute numeric grades for a course. The course records are in a file that will serve as the input file. The input file is in exactly the following format: Each line contains a student's last name, then one space, then the student's first name, then one space, then ten quiz scores all on one line. The quiz scores are whole numbers and are separated by one space. Your program will take its input from this file and send its output to a second file. The data in the output file will be the same as the data in the input file except that there will be one additional number (of type double) at the end of each line. This number will be the average of the student's ten quiz scores. Use at least one funciton that has file streams as all or some of its arguments."

Project Q12
"Write a program that will correct a C++ program that has errors in which operator, << or >>, it uses with cin and cout. The program replaces each (incorrect) occurrence of cin << with the corrected version cin >> and each (incorrect) occurrence of cout >> with the corrected version cout <<.

For an easier version, assume that there is always exactly one blank space between any occurrence of cin and a following <<, and similarly assume that there is always exactly one blank space between each occurrence of cout and a following >>."
